## 1\. Open  with Windows Run Dialog
Hold down the **Windows logo key** and press R on your keyboard(win + r) and it will open the Run dialog. Type **powershell** and click **ok**,  and it will open powershell.

## 3\. Open Start Menu Context
You can easily open the start menu context by pressing **Windows logo key** and **X**(win + x) at the same time and click **Windows Powershell** from there.

Or you can right click on the  start menu button, and it will open a context where you can open Powershell.

## 4\. Open it from Start Menu
Go to start menu and then all apps and scroll down to apps starting with the letter **W**. You will find a folder **Window Powershell**. When you expand the folder, click on **Windows Powershell**.
