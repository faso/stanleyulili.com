### What is Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows execution of JavaScript outside the browser. It makes it possible to run JavaScript on the backend just other languages such as Python, Php or Ruby do.

Before node.js, JavaScript only executed in the browser. It all changed in 2009 when [Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) created Node.js by building on Google's V8 Engine. The V8 engine is compiler used in Google Chrome and Chromium based browsers to parse JavaScript.
