## Prerequisites

<!-- Prerequisites let you leverage existing tutorials so you don't have to repeat installation or setup steps in your tutorial.  Learn more at https://do.co/style#prerequisites -->

Before you begin this guide you'll need the following:

- [number of servers] <OS and OS Version> server(s) <!-- Also specify the amount of RAM the server needs if relevant. -->
- A non-root user with sudo privileges (<insert link to Initial Server Setup article for the OS used in this tutorial>) explains how to set this up.)
- (Optional) If software such as Nginx needs to be installed, link to the proper article describing how to install it.
- (Optional) If the reader needs a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), mention it here as well.
- (Optional) List any other accounts needed, such as GitHub, Facebook,  or other services.

<!-- Example:
* One Ubuntu 18.04 server with at least 1GB of RAM set up by following [the Ubuntu 18.04 initial server setup guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04), including a sudo non-root user and a firewall.
* Nginx installed on your server, as shown in [How To Install Nginx on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04).
* A domain name configured to point to your server. You can learn how to point domains to DigitalOcean Droplets by following the [How To Set Up a Host Name with DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean) tutorial.

<!-- Some examples of how to mark up various things

This is _italics_ and this is **bold**.

Only use italics and bold for specific things. Learn more at https://do.co/style#bold-and-italics

This is `inline code`. Use it for referencing package names and commands.

Here's a command someone types in the Terminal:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Here's a configuration file. The label on the first line lets you clearly state the file that's being shown or modified:

```nginx
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/default]
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

    root <^>/usr/share/nginx/html<^>;
    index index.html index.htm;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Here's output from a command:

```
[secondary_label Output]
Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused
```

Learn about formatting commands and terminal output at https://do.co/style#code

Key presses should be written in ALLCAPS with in-line code formatting: `ENTER`.

Use a plus symbol (+) if keys need to be pressed simultaneously: `CTRL+C`.

This is a <^>variable<^>.

This is an `<^>in-line code variable<^>`

Learn more about how to use variables to highlight important items at https://do.co/style#variables

Use `<^>your_server_ip<^>` when referencing the IP of the server.  Use `111.111.111.111` and `222.222.222.222` if you need other IP addresses in examples.
