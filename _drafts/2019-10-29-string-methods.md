In this article, we are going to take an indepth look on how to use the ES6 string methods:
- startsWith() method
- endsWith() method
- includes() method
- repeat() method

## String Basics
Before we look at the new string methods. Let's recap on what happens when you create a new string.

when you create a string, every character in the string is assigned an index.

For example let' create a simple string:
```javascript
const myString = 'String Methods';
```

So you can access any character from the string like we can access elements in an array:

```javascript
const myString = 'String Methods';
myString[0] // S
myString[6] // " " 
myString[9] // t
```

This does not mean that strings are array. 

```javascript
Array.isArray(myString) // false
```
