title: working with files in Node.js
### Introduction
fs module also known as File system.

Helpful for automatic things

## Using fs module

To use the fs module.

You need to require it first on top of file.

```
const fs = require('fs');
```

## how to read a file
inside the folder `playground`, create a file `readme.txt`.

Paste the following contents:

 ```
 This is  a file that needs to be read
 ```
reading a file synchonous version
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const file = fs.readFileSync('./readme.txt', {encoding: 'utf-8'})
console.log(file);
```
In synchronous, what happens is that the file is read and then saved into the variable file and then the next line `console.log(file);` will execute.

You encode the file in `utf-8` because it supports many langugaes. encoding is --- You need to search this--

Output:
```
This is  a file that needs to be read
```

asyncronous

** needs googline**

when the file is read, something will fire and of the file happens in the background. The next lines continue executing until you are elerted that the file is doen.
## how to writing a file
Writing a file you use 

syncronous:

```
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('./hello.txt', 'hello from node');
```

This creates a file.

If you list directory contents you will see that the file has been created.

```
ls

// hello.txt  main.js  readme.txt
```
We can confirm the content has been written by
```
cat hello.txt
// hello from node
```

## how to check if a file exists

## how to create a directory

## rename directory

## delete directory

## remove contents(truncate)
## copy a file

## Idea: create a scaffolding tools
