I'm Stanley Ulili, a freelance web developer and researcher from Malawi.

I started my blog as a journal to document everything I learn. I love learning new things, and  writing  helps me understand and solidify  concepts.

I hope by sharing my experience, others can learn something from them.

### Languages I have worked with:
- Python(Django)
- Html and Css
- Javascript
